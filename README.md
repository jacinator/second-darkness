# The Second Darkness

This repository contains the code for a game by that name. I hope to set up a server with Django
soon and get this working as a website or so, but for now it's just a text based game. It's not
really fully debugged yet either, though my younger brother loves to play it.

## About the game

The Second Darkness is a game based off of J.R.R. Tolkien's works, namely Middle Earth\*. It
supposes the War of the Ring in full swing during the rise of Sauron in the Third Age. You have to
manually set which faction you want to play as in the faction's folder. If you want to play as a
faction go to ```<faction_folder>/__init__.py``` and change ```AI = True``` to ```AI = False```.

There are a lot of factions and some of them are quite strong (Mordor or Gondor), while others are
quite weak (Beornings or the Ents).

Have fun with this, and leave a comment or an issue or something.
